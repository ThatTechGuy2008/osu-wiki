# Stream

A stream is an osu! pattern where many hit circles are placed close together and in quick succession. Streams usually represent high note density in a song and they are most commonly snapped to 1/4 ticks on the timeline. These patterns require precise timing and rhythm to hit accurately, often challenging playersâ€™ stamina and finger control. Streams can vary in length and speed, sometimes appearing as short bursts or long, continuous sequences. Mastering streams is essential for high-level play, as they frequently appear in difficult beatmaps. Players often practice specific stream maps to improve their skill and consistency. Additionally, streams can be combined with other patterns, such as jumps or sliders, to create complex and engaging gameplay experiences.

Streams are usually played with smooth movement, as opposed to the snappy movement of [jumps](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!/Jump). Most streams require the player to alternate clicking between both fingers due to their speed.
